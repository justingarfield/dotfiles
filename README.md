# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

## Repository Status

Working heavily on Windows 11 provisioning process...It's not ready yet, so hold-fast while I get it finished. Things like the Night Light and Mouse Pointer Style / Size are a super PITA to toggle correctly, so it's taking a few.

**Windows 11 functionality will be migrated to an actual PowerShell Module** once I get enough of it completed in this repository _(just makes it faster to test with atm)_.

## Prereqs

* Windows 11 folder expects you're running PowerShell 7 _(I'm using the ternary operator)_.
